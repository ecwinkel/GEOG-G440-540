## Class Project

Each student will complete a class project which will be to learn in depth one particular part of the model (e.g. carbon cycle, or water cycle) and present that to the rest of the class. Each student will be given a reading list relevant to their chosen topic, but they will be encouraged to seek out other journal articles to complement their knowledge. The grade will be based on the detail and quality of the presentation., a 2-3 page literature review on the studentâ€™s chosen topic, and a 10 question quiz the student prepares on the topic for the rest of the class.

*Additional requirement for G589 students*: the class project will be more extensive and based on your research interests. It will make up a greater percentage of your overall grade. Students will be expected to seek out further material in the form of journal articles than the reading list they are given.

**Quizzes**: as part of the Class Project, each student will prepare a 10 question quiz to test if the rest of the class has understood the material. The rest of the class will take all the set by the other students in their class and the overall grade will be the average across those quizzes.

In this directory you will find a powerpoint presentation introducing the various components of the class project as well as a grading rubric for each component. A reading list for each student will also be provided depending upon their chosen topic.

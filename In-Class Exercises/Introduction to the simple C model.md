# Simple two pool carbon cycle model

In the in-class exercises we'll be building and analyzing results from a simple two pool carbon model (Fig 1)

Figure 1: Model schematic of the two pool simple carbon cycle model.

The two pools correspond to the litter and soil C pools.

Inputs to the model are litter and soil temperature and moisture and litterfall from leaves falling off trees (as well as turnover of dead wood).

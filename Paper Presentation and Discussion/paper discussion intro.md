## Paper presentation and discussion: 

During the final part of the semester we will be discussing contemporary literature as a group. Students will take turns to lead the discussion for each of those papers/articles. The grade will be based both on completing 1 page of questions per article to show their understanding of the material presented in the article, as well as each studentsâ€™ effectiveness in leading an engaging discussion on the article they lead the discussion for. Students will be taught methods of reading and discussing journal articles before this part of the course.
